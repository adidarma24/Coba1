  /// 1. Consistent structure across all endpoints
  /// 2. Easy to add metadata (timestamp, pagination, etc)
  /// 3. Clear success/failure indication
  /// 4. Additional context with messages
  /// 
  /// Example success response:
  /// {
  ///   "success": true,
  ///   "data": { "transactionId": "TXN123", ... },
  ///   "message": "Transfer completed successfully",
  ///   "timestamp": "2025-10-05T12:30:45Z"

    /// - List<TransactionResponseDto> for list endpoint
